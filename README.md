# ðŸ§  The Walking LLMs

What if our favorite language models â€” ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral â€” had a body?

Not just APIs we type intoâ€¦ but something that walks, runs, maybe even sits beside us.

That thought spiraled into an architecture. That architecture became a prototype.  
And now, itâ€™s a research paper.

ðŸ“„ **Paper:** [Final The Walking LLMs.pdf](https://github.com/sawnthoosh/The-Walking-LLMs/blob/main/Final%20The%20Walking%20LLMs.pdf?raw=true)

ðŸ§ª **Built independently** â€” no lab, no team, just curiosity (and a little help from an LLM for formatting, not thinking ðŸ˜„).  
Not claiming itâ€™s *the* solution â€” just *an idea worth exploring.*

If you're into embodied cognition, speculative AI, or just like unusual architectures â€” have a look.  
Feedback and discussions welcome.
