This paper proposes a modular, protocol-driven framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with physical robotic systems — enabling them to walk, perceive, and interact with the real world.

## Abstract
We introduce the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — a communication interface allowing LLMs to coordinate modular robotic components (legs, arms, vision, etc.) through high-level natural language reasoning. This bridges cognition and physicality in AI.
